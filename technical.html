                              <p>The CUTE experiment surface allocation has been defined considering: the surface and height needed
                                        for CUTE, the access required for SuperCDMS, and the access and surface limitation for the other
                                        experiments in the drift. An accurate model of the cavern (developed from a LIDAR scan) has been used to optimize the
                                        exact position of CUTE</p>
                              <p>The overall system has been divided into sub-systems: the platform, the crane, the clean room, the dilution gas handling system (GHS),
                                   the pulse-tube (PT) compressor, the aquisition system (DAQ), the ultra-pure water (UPW) and water circulation pump, and the cooling loop system. For more information see the full documentation below.</p>

                         </div>
     
                         <div class="blog-post-des">
                              <p>The Cryostat used is a dilution refrigerator (DR) which is a fundamental part of the facility that allows the detectors being tested to reach millikelvin temperatures. 
                                   The Cryostat used is a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator developed by <a href = "http://cryoconcept.com/"><strong>CryoConcept</strong></a> for the CUTE Facility's specific needs. 
                                   The design requirements and key design aspects of the Cryostat are as follows:</p>
                              <p>- The base temperature of the DR is driven by the detector's requirements.</p>
                              <p>- The cooling power of the coldest stages (1K, 0.1K and 13mK) are driven by the cooldown time,
                                        more than the stationary thermal loads during operation.</p>
                              <p>- Due to the large mass of lead (~100 kg) added to provide a low radioactivity background, and to
                                        the mass of the Detector Tower (~20 kg), special cares have been taken to provide some
                                        thermal links acting as heat switches between the 4K & 1K stages needed to keep the cooldown
                                        time below 1 week</p>
                              <p>- The microvibrations transmission between the Pulse Tube Head and the detectors is a major
                                        issue in such kind of cryostat. A careful analysis has been done to drive the main choices of the
                                        design; i.e. the type of supports, the impact of the various bellows stiffness and the global
                                        arrangement of the perturbative elements mounted at the top of the cryostat</p>
                               <p>- The physical space constraints at SNOLAB, which is a severe limitation, was a driver for the
                                        architecture of the top of the cryostat and the operations on the Detector Tower. For more information see the full documentation below.</p>

                                   <p>For the nominal shielding, the neutron flux is attenuated by the water, except from the top where only
                                             a lead shield is installed close to the top of the detector tower. Low radioactivity materials have been selected in
                                             the field of view of the detector (mainly pure copper). As a result of mechanical and cost constraints, the external
                                             can of the cryostat is made of selected stainless steel. A magnetic shield (1 mm-thick mu-metal cylinder)
                                             is be mounted around the cryostat external can.</p>
                                             <p>In order to lower the gamma flux and have a better closure of the top field-of-view, an external lead shield
                                                       was added (100 mm on the side walls and 150 mm on the bottom). This lowers the
                                                       experimental background by about an order of magnitude. For more information see the full documentation below.</p>

                              <p>The platform is an elevated steel support structure, centered over the water shield tank. The platform
                                        supports the mass of the experiment, and allows access for staff during installation, and for
                                        transfer of the cryostat to the clean room. Due to space constraints, and infrequent access requirements
                                        during detector operation, access to the platform is from a high-incline “ships ladder” type stairway. </p>
                              <p>The crane is a 1 tonne (1000 kg) freestanding monorail, coupled directly to the top of the steel platform.
                                   The monorail runs along the east/west center line of the platform, and includes a 5 ft. cantilever off the
                                   east side</p>
                              <p>The main function of the crane is to move the cryostat between the platform and the clean room for
                                   mounting and dismounting of the Detector Tower. The rated lifting capacity of 1 tonne is chosen to
                                   provide a large margin of safety compared to the mass of the suspended system (< 500 kg). The crane
                                   will also be used for assembly phases (e.g. installation of the support vessels, and mounting the external
                                   lead shield upgrade). For more information see the full documentation below.</p>

                                   <p>Vibrations have a huge impact on the sensitivity of cryogenic detectors by introducing microphonic noise and
                                             spurious thermal loads. The main source of microvibrations is the Pulse-Tube head mounted on the cryostat top-flange. The
                                             induced vibrations on the detector are minimized by designing a highly damped supporting structure and
                                             a gaseous thermal link between the Pulse-Tube and the cryostat (the ‘ULTRA-QUIET SYSTEM’ from
                                             Cryoconcept). </p>
                                   <p>Minus-K dampers have been used in the design of the suspension system such that 
                                        the minimum static load required to have optimal damping characteristics is achieved. Additionally, because
                                        the suspension stiffness is too low to keep the position tolerances in case of a presssure variation, a remote
                                        system used to correct the position has been designed. For more information see the full documentation below.

                              <p>The clean room is mounted on the platform. It provides a low Radon ambient environment to limit the Radon exposition
                                        on the Detector Tower during the mounting or dismounting operation.
                                        SNOLAB air has a Radon content of ~130 Bq/ m3
                                        , which is considered too high. The solution is to use
                                        surface air (~3 Bq/ m3
                                        ). The air must be filtered (particulate, oil and coalescing, carbon adsorption), and
                                        will be tested according to limits set out by CSA Z180.1 – 00 in order to certify it as human breathing air.
                                        The typical ventilation rate of 1 volume/hour is ~50 m3
                                        /h (~30 CFM) with de-radonized air (< 0.1 Bq/m3
                                        ).
                                        Both the filter and the fan will be included within the clean room structure.</p>
                                        <p>When the de-radonized air facility is available from SuperCDMS, it could be used for our clean room
                                                  air supply.
                                                  The total expected Radon for a complete mounting/dismounting cycle is 10 Bq/m3
                                                  .h for a maximum
                                                  accepted exposition of 80 Bq/m3

                              <p>The ultra pure water tank consists of a
                                        cylindrical “grain bin” style stainless steel tank, assembled from corrugated sheets. A backing PVC layer,
                                        covering the floors and wall, is installed first. Inside the backing layer, the watertight PVC liner is
                                        installed. A flexible PVC lid is clamped around the top support vessel, and covers the top of the water
                                        tank. Four bulkhead fittings for tank services are fastened to a stainless steel plate at the perimeter of
                                        the lid. Six vertical stiffeners distributed around the tank are used to support a stiffening ring near the
                                        floor, used to tie off and support the liners and lid.</p>
                              <p>The Ultra Pure Water Circulation System is used to keep the water clean and limit biological growth. The system combines a particle filter with a UV
                                   sterilizer. A pump is required to circulate the water into the filtering system. The recirculation rate is
                                   compatible with a complete tank content circulation within one day. For more information see the full documentation below.</p>
