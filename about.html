                                        <p>CUTE is a Cryogenic Underground TEst facility that provides the infrastructure necessary for the testing and
                                         development of cryogenic particle detectors. It is located in drift C3 of the SNOLAB underground laboratory in
                                         Sudbury, Canada. At a depth of about 2000 metres, the facility is shielded from cosmic rays and their secondary
                                         particles that would otherwise disrupt the search for rare events in physics. Additional water, lead and polyethylene
                                         shielding creates a low-background environment and a dilution refrigeration system cools the installed detectors to
                                         temperatures as low as 10 millikelvin.</p>

                                        <p>The facility simulates the operating conditions of a cryogenic particle detector using several key systems.
                                              A cylindrical ultra-pure water tank is installed underneath a stable access platform and is continually
                                              filtered for biological contaminants. Attached to the platform is a water-tight, hollow structure that extends
                                              down into the water tank, creating what’s called the drywell. Permanently inside the drywell are two lead shields
                                              and a thin mu-metal shield, protecting from background and magnetic field respectively. During operation, a cryostat
                                              containing the dilution refrigeration system, a stack of detectors and an additional lead shield between them is
                                              placed inside the drywell and shielded from above by a movable high density polyethylene layer. A vibration damping
                                              system is used to reduce microvibrations caused by the refrigeration system that create unwanted heat signals. The
                                              detectors in the cryostat can only be accessed from a clean room with reduced airborne radon concentrations, located
                                              beside the access platform. The cryostat is moved from the drywell to the cleanroom using a 1 tonne monorail
                                              and hoist. Farther from the platform is the gas handling system, which regulates the cryostat’s refrigeration
                                              system, and the data acquisition system that reads from the detectors.</p>

                                        <p>Cryogenic particle detectors look for direct interactions between the detector and weakly interacting
                                         particles in a low-background, low-temperature environment. When a particle collides with a detector nucleus,
                                         energy is deposited in the form of phonons (heat) and electron-ion pairs. This energy can be as low as a few tens
                                         of electron-volts, rendering it invisible in the thermal noise of normal temperatures. Additionally, certain material
                                         properties become sensitive to small energy deposits at low temperatures, which is why the detectors are cooled near
                                         absolute zero. Background particles such as gamma rays, neutrons, alpha particles, and beta particles can also collide
                                         with the detector, depositing energy and creating noise. Heavy shielding is typically implemented around the detectors to
                                         reduce the frequency of these background events, and measuring both phonon and charge signals provides discrimination between
                                         electron (background) and nuclear recoils. These detectors have the potential to answer fundamental questions about the
                                         universe by searching for known and theoretical particles such as neutrinos, axions and WIMPs.</p>

                                        <p>The Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SuperCDMS) project will be testing their HV and iZip detectors at the CUTE 
                                             facility. Both detector types exploit material properties at cryogenic temperatures by using transition edge sensors to 
                                             detect the generated phonons. The iZip detectors will also measure charge signals and can therefore discriminate between 
                                             electron and nuclear recoils. Using the CUTE facility, SuperCDMS aims to test and validate an entire detector tower 
                                             (6 detectors and electronics), take measurements in a low-background environment and characterize the detectors for 
                                             intrinsic background and noise issues. Additionally, the SuperCDMS screening program and handling procedures will be 
                                             validated. Using the CUTE facility will help set up SuperCDMS for success and enable an exciting early science run for 
                                             dark matter research.</p>
